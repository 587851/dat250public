## DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 1

### Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to ensure that you have a working Software Development Environment installed on your PC which will be needed in the remainder of this course. As part of the installation, you will have to validate that the installed software development environment is working properly.

If you encounter problems during the installation of the software development environment, then please post your questions and issues on the Canvas discussion forum for the DAT250 course.

Note that this is an **individual** assignment (see Hand-in at the end of the document).

### Installation: Software Development Environment

You must make sure that you have the following installed on your PC:

- Java Development Environment (JDK): https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html

- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which could be Eclipse: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/ , IntelliJ: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/, or some other IDE of your choice.

- Maven software management tool: https://maven.apache.org

- A Git client: https://git-scm.com

In addition, you must make sure that you have a GitHub account: https://github.com, which you will use for handing in the assignments in the course.

### Experiment: Heroku and Platform as a Service

In this experiment, you are to deploy a small Java application in the cloud using the Heroku cloud application platform: https://www.heroku.com

For the experiment, you need to create an account on Heroku and apply for a student developer pack via https://blog.heroku.com/github-student-developer-program in order to be able to deploy applications in the cloud.

Complete the tutorial for deploying Java applications on the Heroku cloud platform:

### Hand-in: short report

As hand in, you must create a repository on GitHub and inside the repository add a markdown file called `dat250-expass1.md`, containing a short laboratory report documenting what you have done.

You can find information about markdown here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

In particular, you should write about:

- technical problems that you encountered during installation of the software development environment and how you have solved them
- how you have *validated* (checked) that the software development environment is working
- technical problems encountered with the Heroku platform and how you solved them
- any pending issues with this assignment which you did not manage to solve

**Please add the URL to your deployed Heroku app at the end of your report.**

The hand-in must be written in **English**.
